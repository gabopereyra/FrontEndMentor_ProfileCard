## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
The most important thing I had learned, was about the position of the objects, and how to play with the SVG, in special, how to make it adaptable for various resolutions without having to use media queries.
Another knowledges I have won with this challenge are about the propertie "box-sizing" and its effects in padding and margin; also about the relative measures, likes vh or vw. 

### Continued development

How to apply correctly GRID, for moments I fell with doubts about its behaviour.
